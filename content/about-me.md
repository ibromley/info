Hello! I'm **Iain Bromley**, and I will be a software engineer at [Visa](https://usa.visa.com/) this fall. I just recieved my Bachelors degree from the [Information School](https://ischool.uw.edu/) at the [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu/). I love learning about new technologies, developing solutions to challenging problems, and *changing lives* with information (okay, maybe not that last one). Also, I have a penchant for transportation networks and their respective infrastructure, specifically in the [Greater Seattle Area](https://seattletransitblog.com/). If you're intersted or want to connect, feel free to reach out!
